####Sets

**Definition**: Sets are data structures that allow you to store unqiue values of any type.

Sets are similiar to objects but rather than containing key value pairs, sets only contain keys. Elements in a set are not store in order which is the opposite of an array. Sets are similiar to objects where every key is unique (e.g. no duplicate keys are allowed).
