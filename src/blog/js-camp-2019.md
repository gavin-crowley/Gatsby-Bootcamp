##Tracy Lee
_CEO, This Dot Labs_
_\* Currently hiring_

**Inclusive Architecture**

- Help on-boarding junior devs
- More productivity

**PAMstack**
_Process, abstraction & mentorship_

- Process
  - Create checklists
- Abstractions
  - Web development includes preformance, security, accessibility, responsive design, etc.
- Mentorship
  - Company culture shifting from promoting a dev to senior to needing to mentor a junior to their current role
  - Hiring is expensive
  - Benefits
    - 70% more likely to stay with mentorship program
    - Mentors are 6x more likely to be promoted
  - Implementation
    - Format 1:1 meetings
    - Code reviews
    - Pair programming where junior drives and senior navigates
    - Tech talk presentations during lunch
    - Create documentations for various processes
    - Ask for code reviews
    - If team likes these processes then ask for formal implementation
- Email: hi@this.co

##Chris Hernandez
_CTO, Own It Technologies_

**ReasonML**

- Created by Facebook and used in FB messenger
- Faster to test compared to Javascript & Jest

**Computer Science**

- Big O Notation

  - Measures runtime efficiency for a given algorithm
  - Input size, hardware, language, etc. does not matter
  - O(1) constant time
    - E.g. combine butter & sugar for 3 minutes
  - O(n) linear time
    - Runtime increases in direct propotion to input size. Typical runtime for a single for loop.
    - E.g. beat eggs for 1 minute per egg
  - O(n^2)
    - Nested for loops
  - O(n^3)
    - Three nested for loops, etc.
  - O(2^n) exponential time
    - E.g. recursive finonacci sequence
  - O(log n)
    - E.g. binary search cutting input size by half every operation

- Set Theory
  - Used for all relational databases such as SQL
  - Application: E-commerce user filter
  - Union X u Y
    - E.g. two overlaying circles where one circle represents IG accounts that post pictures of dogs
  - Intersection X n Y
    - Overlaying section of two circles
  - Different X - Y
    - Left side only
  - Relative Compliment Y \ X
    - Right side only

Recursion

- Russian dolls where they look the same but smaller doll can be placed inside another doll
- A function that calls itself
  - All recursive solutions can be done iteratively
  - Base case is where the recursive loop ends
  -

Object Oriented Programming consists of encapsalations, abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism

- Encapsulation
  - Doesn't allow a user to modify an object's state
  - Like a helper method
- Abstraction
  - E.g. increasing the volume on a phone or TV
- Inheritance
  - All plants need sun, soil and water to grow
  - E.g. a web app that provides instructions for caring for a specific plant
  - Child object inherant all characteristics from the parent object
- Polymorphism
  - Using multiple classes in the same way
  - E.g. knitting
